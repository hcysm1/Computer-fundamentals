The parameters needed by puttytel to establish a proper
connection are : 
1- localhost or 127.0.0.1 which is the IP loopback address because we need an IP address of the server to which we want to connect. 
2- 8989 which is the port number of the server because we need to specify which port number we need to connect to.

Functions used in server are as follows:
1- first of all we will initialize winSock because windows use dynamically linked libraries so we need to startup the winSock.
   It allows an application or DLL to specify the version of Windows Sockets required and retrieve details of the specific Windows Sockets implementation.
2- After initializing WinSock we will create Socket.The socket() function creates an unbound socket in a communications domain
   and return a file descriptor that can be used in later function calls that operate on sockets.
3- After creation of the socket. we will use bind function which is used to bind the socket to the address and port number specified
   in addr(custom data structure).
4- After that we need to make it a listening socket.It puts the server socket in a passive mode. where it waits for the client to 
   approach the server to make a connection. 
5- Then accept function is used to accept the connection from client It extracts the first connection request on the queue of pending 
   connections for the listening socket which creates a new connected socket, and returns a new file descriptor referring to that socket.
   At this point, connection is established between client and server, and they are ready to transfer data.
6- Then receive function is used to get request from client.
7- Then Send function is used to send back the response to client.
8- Then close function is used to close the socket.
9- To reset and automatically deallocate the socket we call WSAcleanup.
